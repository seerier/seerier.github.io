- Implemented wave-optical rendering framework for physical light transport simulation beyond geometric optics.
- Derived closed-form edge-based Fraunhofer diffraction formulation, enabling free-space diffraction in path tracing without phase-carrying rays.
- Conducted convergence analysis comparing discretized RGB and continuous spectral wavelength models.
