Developed a high-performance C++ simulation engine solving high-dimensional light transport equations via Monte-Carlo integration.

- Implemented advanced variance reduction techniques (Importance Sampling, MIS) and stochastic algorithms (Path Tracing, Bidirectional Path Tracing, Metropolis-Hastings Light Transport)
- Optimized performance through multithreading and efficient memory management
